    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known planet to support life. It has a unique combination of liquid water, an oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a stable climate that makes life possible. About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, while the rest consists of continents and islands. The planet has a layered structure, including a solid inner core, a molten outer core, a mantle, and a crust where we live. Earth's atmosphere, primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, protects life by shielding it from harmful solar radiation and maintaining a habitable temperature through the greenhouse effect. Orbiting the Sun in about 365.25 days, Earth also rotates on its axis, giving rise to day and night. With its diverse ecosystems, rich biodiversity, and dynamic geology, Earth remains a marvel of the solar system.</p>
