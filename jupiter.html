    <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, a gas giant known for its immense size and striking appearance. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, lacking a solid surface, and has a massive atmosphere with turbulent storms and colorful cloud bands. The most iconic feature of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm larger than Earth that has persisted for centuries. Jupiter has a strong magnetic field and at least 95 known moons, including the four largest—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—known as the Galilean moons. These moons are diverse and fascinating, with Europa believed to harbor a subsurface ocean that might support life. Jupiter plays a crucial role in the solar system, influencing the orbits of nearby objects with its immense gravity. It orbits the Sun every 12 Earth years and continues to captivate astronomers as a key subject of exploration and study.</p>
