    <p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size and composition. However, Venus is a hostile world with extreme conditions. It has a thick atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid, creating a powerful greenhouse effect that makes it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures reaching around 475°C (900°F). Venus rotates slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets, causing a day on Venus to be longer than a Venusian year. Its surface is covered with vast plains, volcanic features, and craters, but its harsh environment makes exploration challenging. Despite its infernal conditions, Venus remains a focus of scientific study due to its intriguing geology and atmospheric dynamics.</p>
