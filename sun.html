    <p>The Sun is a massive, glowing sphere of hot plasma at the center of our solar system, providing the energy that sustains life on Earth. It is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium and generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, converting hydrogen into helium and releasing immense heat and light. The Sun’s surface temperature is around 5,500°C (9,932°F), while its core reaches temperatures of about 15 million°C (27 million°F). It plays a crucial role in driving Earth's climate, weather, and seasons, making it essential for life on our planet. Despite being an average-sized star, the Sun contains over 99.8% of the solar system's mass and is about 4.6 billion years old.    </p>
