    <p>Pluto is a dwarf planet located in the Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies beyond Neptune. Once considered the ninth planet of the solar system, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union due to its small size and inability to clear its orbit of other debris. Pluto is about 2,377 kilometers in diameter, making it smaller than Earth's Moon, and has a surface composed of ice, rock, and frozen nitrogen.

        Pluto has a thin atmosphere primarily made of nitrogen, which expands when it is closer to the Sun and freezes when it moves farther away in its elliptical orbit. It takes about 248 Earth years for Pluto to complete one orbit around the Sun. Pluto has five known moons, with Charon being the largest. Charon is so massive relative to Pluto that they are sometimes considered a double dwarf planet system. Despite its distance and small size, Pluto captured global attention when NASA's New Horizons spacecraft provided detailed images and data during its 2015 flyby, revealing a surprisingly complex and dynamic world.</p>
